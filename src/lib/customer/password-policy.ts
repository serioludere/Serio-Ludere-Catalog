// The customer password policy — the one piece of `customer/auth.ts` that BOTH realms need.
//
// Why this is its own module and not just another export of `customer/auth.ts`:
//
// `customer/auth.ts` imports `node:crypto` at the top for scrypt, HMAC and `timingSafeEqual`. The
// admin's Customers screen (`src/scripts/admin/clients.ts`) wants to validate a typed password
// before sending it, so it imported the checker from there — which dragged the whole server module
// into the browser bundle. Vite externalises `node:crypto` for the browser and its stub THROWS on
// first property access, so the import failed at module scope and every handler on that page never
// bound: "Add customer", "Reset password" and the Active switch all silently did nothing.
//
// A build warning said exactly this ("Module node:crypto has been externalized … imported by
// src/lib/customer/auth.ts") and was not acted on.
//
// So: anything the client needs lives here, and this file must never import a Node builtin. The
// server keeps importing it through `customer/auth.ts`, which re-exports it, so server callers are
// unchanged.
