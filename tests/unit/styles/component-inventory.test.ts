// Every component in src/components/ui is either used, or declared as built-ahead-of-its-screen.
//
// This project built the whole Figma component set before the screens that consume it, so "unused"
// is a normal and temporary state — but silently unused is how a parallel system starts. Two of them
// (UnitToggle, CurrencyPicker) had already become duplicates of a shipping control before anyone
// noticed, and were removed on 2026-09-14.
//
// So the rule is not "everything must be used". It is "nothing is unused by accident": a component
// with no consumer has to be listed below, with the Figma node it implements and the screen that
// will consume it. A new orphan fails this test and has to be justified in one line.

/**
 * Components with no consumer yet, each with the node it implements and what will use it.

 * Removing an entry means the component is now used. Adding one means accepting that it ships
 * unreferenced — which is only reasonable while the screen it belongs to is genuinely still to come.
